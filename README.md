# Implementation and Guide for `yulaw` Function

## Introduction
This document provides an overview of the JavaScript function `yulaw`, which is designed to remove duplicate characters from a string. The goal of `yulaw` is to process a given string and return a new string with only the first occurrence of each character, effectively filtering out any duplicates. This function can be particularly useful in contexts where character uniqueness within a string is necessary, such as generating unique identifiers, simplifying strings, or in certain cryptographic applications.

## Solution Overview
The `yulaw` function accepts a single argument: a string `s`. It then iterates over each character in the input string, adding each unique character to an array `yulawd`. If a character is already present in the array (and thus has been encountered before in the string), it is skipped. After processing the entire string, the array of unique characters is joined back into a single string, which is then returned as the output.

## How It Works
Here's a step-by-step explanation of the function's logic:

1. **Initialization**: An empty array `yulawd` is created to store unique characters.

2. **Iteration and Filtering**: The function iterates over the string `s`. For each character:
   - The function checks if the current character is not already included in `yulawd`.
   - If the character is not found in `yulawd`, it is appended to the array. This ensures that only the first occurrence of each character is retained.

3. **Result Construction**: After the iteration is complete, the `yulawd` array, which now contains only unique characters from the original string, is converted back into a string using the `join("")` method.

4. **Return**: The newly constructed string, free of duplicate characters, is returned.

## Algorithm Complexity
- **Time Complexity**: O(n^2), where `n` is the length of the input string. This is because the `includes` method runs in O(n) time for each character in the string, leading to quadratic overall time complexity.
- **Space Complexity**: O(n), where `n` is the length of the input string. This is the worst-case scenario where all characters in the input string are unique.

## Usage Example
Below are examples demonstrating how to use the `yulaw` function:

```javascript
const { yulaw } = require('./pathToYourFile');

console.log(yulaw("hello")); // Output: "helo"
console.log(yulaw("world")); // Output: "world"
console.log(yulaw("javascript")); // Output: "javscrip"
console.log(yulaw("characters")); // Output: "charates"
console.log(yulaw("")); // Output: ""
```

## Conclusion
The `yulaw` function is a straightforward and useful tool for removing duplicate characters from strings, ensuring that each character is represented only once. Its simplicity makes it suitable for various applications where character uniqueness is required. However, for very long strings, consider optimizations or alternative methods to improve performance due to its quadratic time complexity.
